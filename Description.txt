Pattern Choice:
I opted to implement an object pool to an existing shooting mechanic that I made in a past project.
The old scripts used the inefficient method of Instantiating and deleting the bullet prefabs, so using
this design pattern was a no-brainer :)

Used Resources:
I primarily used a Unity Learn tutorial for how to make a simple object pool
(source: https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/introduction-to-object-pooling#5ff8d015edbc2a002063971d)

How did the implementation go?:
Fairly seamless, I only had to add an "ObjectPool" script, and rework a couple of older scripts by
replacing the instantiate and destroy calls to fit with the newly added pool.

Any deviation from the resource(s)?:
Not really, the tutorial was fairly straightforward and easy to understand. The entire mechanic
was up and running after the first try, so I couldn't really think of a way to make it even 
smoother.
